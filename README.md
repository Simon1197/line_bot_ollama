# LINE Llama Bot Setup

This repository contains a LINE bot that integrates with Ollama's models. Follow the instructions below to get the bot up and running.

## Prerequisites

- **Ollama**: Ensure you have Ollama installed and configured.  
- **ngrok**: Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet.  
- **Python**: Install Python (version 3.7 or higher).  
- **LINE Official Account**: A valid account with Messaging API credentials.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Check Available Models

Run the following command to list the available models in Ollama:

```bash
ollama list
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```
NAME                  ID              SIZE      MODIFIED

gemma3:27b            30ddded7fba6    17 GB     3 days ago      
gemma:2b              b50d6c999e59    1.7 GB    3 days ago
```
You can check https://ollama.com/ for avaliable model download

Example for model download

```
ollama pull gemma3:4b
```

### 2. Start ngrok Tunnel

To expose your local server, run ngrok on the port your application uses (for example, port 5000):

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

debug for ngrok occupied

```
brew update
brew reinstall --cask ngrok

chmod +x /path/to/ngrok
```

After starting ngrok, you will receive a URL similar to:

```
https://<temporary-code>.ngrok-free.app
```

### 3. Configure LINE Messaging API Webhook

Log in to your LINE Official Account Manager and navigate to the **Messaging API** settings.  
Replace the current Webhook URL with the ngrok URL obtained in Step 2 (e.g., `https://<temporary-code>.ngrok-free.app`).  
This update allows LINE to send webhook events to your local environment.

### 4. Start the LINE Bot

First start the ollama server

```
ollama serve
```

Finally, run the Python script to start your LINE bot:

```bash
python line_llama.py
```

Your LINE bot should now be running and connected to your LINE Official Account!

## Troubleshooting

- **Ollama Models**: Verify that the output of `ollama list` matches the expected models.  
- **ngrok Tunnel**: Ensure ngrok is running and the URL is correctly configured in LINE settings.  
- **Python Script**: Check for any error messages in the terminal when running `python line_llama.py`.
